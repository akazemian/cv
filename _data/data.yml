    title: Work Experience
    info:
      - role: Data Science Intern
        time: 2021
        company: AdHawk Microsystems, Toronto
        details: 
            Trained models on eye-tracking data collected during reading to predict
            cognitive load and text difficulty. The project involved experimental design,
            data collection, data preprocessing, supervised classification of sessions, and
            presentation of results through a user-friendly interface.

        time: 2021
        company: Neobi, Vancouver
        details: 
            Designed pipelines for web scraping, data processing, data visualization, and
            sentiment analysis using product information available on e-commerce
            websites in order to draw insights about the market

      - role: R&D Intern
        time: 2019
        company: Entuitive, Calgary
        details: 
            Trained a neural network on past project data to predict parking renovation
            costs for a new project based on the buildingsâ€™ conditions, which increased
            price estimation accuracy while saving resources spent on manual inspection.
